# Chapter-4: Creating a starter project template
### What I learned
I learned how to setup a reusable project structure in flutter, focusing on organizing files and folders effectively. This included seperating concernsinto directories for features like UI, models, services, and utilities. I also explored best practices for structuring Flutter projects, such as using lib for core functionality, grouping reusable widgets, and following naming conventions to ensure clarity and scalability.

### Achievement
I successfully designed a starter project template with a pre-configured folder structure, base widgets, and essential files. This template serves as a foundation for future projects, reducing setup time and promoting consistency in development.
